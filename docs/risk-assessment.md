# Life in Bloom - Risk Assessment & Mitigation

This document outlines potential risks to the Life in Bloom project and strategies to mitigate them.

## Technical Risks

| Risk                                        | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Performance issues with large player counts | High   | Medium     | Zone-based streaming, player instance limits, optimization sprints    |
| Data loss or corruption                     | High   | Low        | Robust backup systems, data validation, versioning                    |
| Roblox platform changes                     | Medium | Medium     | Stay updated on Roblox roadmap, modular architecture                  |
| Exploit vulnerabilities                     | High   | Medium     | Server authority, thorough validation, security audits                |
| DataStore rate limits                       | High   | High       | Careful DataStore usage, auto-backup, managing remote event frequency |

## Design Risks

| Risk                            | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Core gameplay loop not engaging | High   | Low        | Early prototyping, regular playtesting, iterative design            |
| Economy balance issues          | Medium | Medium     | Simulation testing, soft launch, adjustable parameters              |
| Feature scope creep             | Medium | High       | Clear MVP definition, prioritized backlog, regular scope reviews    |
| Poor monetization performance   | Medium | Medium     | Fair design, player-friendly approach, analytics-driven adjustments |
| Solo developer burnout          | High   | Medium     | Realistic scheduling, regular breaks, clear scope boundaries        |

## Project Risks

| Risk                      | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Resource constraints      | High   | Medium     | Flexible scheduling, prioritized features, scalable team        |
| Timeline delays           | Medium | Medium     | Buffer time in schedule, MVP focus, adjustable scope            |
| Team communication issues | Medium | Low        | Regular meetings, clear documentation, collaboration tools      |
| External dependencies     | Medium | Low        | Minimize third-party reliance, alternative solutions identified |
| Solo developer illness    | High   | Low        | Buffer time in schedule, documented procedures, backup plans    |

## Contingency Planning

### Schedule Buffer
- Each phase includes 2 weeks of buffer time
- Critical path activities have additional padding

### Feature Prioritization
- Features categorized as "Must Have," "Should Have," "Nice to Have"
- Core functionality identified that could be delayed to post-launch if necessary
- Clear dependencies mapped between features

### Technical Alternatives
- Backup technical solutions identified for high-risk features
- Alternative approaches documented for performance-critical systems
- Simplified versions of complex features ready if needed

### External Support Network
- Pre-identified freelancers who could assist in emergency situations
- Knowledge transfer documentation maintained
- Clear onboarding procedures for potential temporary assistance

### Roblox Platform Contingencies
- Strategies for handling DataStore limits
- Alternate approaches for asset streaming issues
- Fallback plans for server resource constraints

### Recovery Procedures
- Data recovery protocols documented
- Rollback procedures established for failed updates
- Communication templates prepared for various incident scenarios

## Risk Monitoring

- Weekly risk review integrated into sprint planning
- Monthly comprehensive risk reassessment
- Trigger events identified that would require immediate risk reassessment
- Clear escalation paths for newly identified risks
