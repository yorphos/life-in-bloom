## 2. Game Vision & Core Gameplay

### 2.1. Core Gameplay Loop

- **Home & Creative Building:**

  - Players start with a modest plot and a “starter” house.
  - Use an intuitive building tool (free placement with grid snapping options) to place furniture, change wall textures, and expand rooms/floors.
  - Homes act as a personal retreat and social hub, and can be shared with friends.

- **Career & Progression:**

  - Choose from a variety of flexible job roles (see full job breakdown below).
  - Each job has its own independent XP pool and level system.
  - Players can switch jobs freely, and mini-games/tasks within each job unlock recipes, tools, or abilities as they progress.

- **Vehicle Ownership & Exploration:**

  - Purchase and customize vehicles ranging from basic bikes to sports cars.
  - Navigate a large open world featuring distinct zones (residential, commercial, industrial, recreational) and hidden secrets.
  - Seasonal changes and occasional travel events (e.g., vacation islands) enrich exploration.

- **Social & Cooperative Play:**

  - A central town hub (with plazas, parks, shopping districts) acts as the primary meeting place.
  - In-game grouping, party systems, and trading enable social interaction and co-op tasks.
  - Special community events (building contests, sports challenges, seasonal festivals) provide shared experiences.

- **Daily Incentives & Community Events:**
  - Daily login rewards, rotating quests, and achievement systems drive long-term engagement.
  - World events (e.g., community cleanup, holiday events) foster cooperation and competition.
