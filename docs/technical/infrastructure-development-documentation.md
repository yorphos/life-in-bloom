## Technical Architecture Overview

### System Architecture

Life in Bloom uses a client-server architecture leveraging Roblox's platform capabilities:

- **Server-Side:** Handles authoritative game logic, data persistence, and security validation
- **Client-Side:** Manages user interface, input handling, and visual effects
- **Shared Modules:** Common utilities and configuration used by both client and server

### Core Systems Breakdown

The game is built around several interconnected systems:

1. **Building System:** Handles placement, customization, and persistence of player-created structures
2. **Job System:** Manages career progression, mini-games, and rewards
3. **Vehicle System:** Controls vehicle physics, customization, and ownership
4. **World Management:** Handles the open world, zones, and dynamic elements
5. **Social System:** Manages player interactions, parties, and trading
6. **Progression System:** Tracks achievements, quests, and player advancement
7. **Economy System:** Manages currencies, purchases, and marketplace

### Technology Stack

- **Game Engine:** Roblox Studio
- **Scripting Language:** Luau (Roblox's Lua variant)
- **Version Control:** Git with Rojo for Roblox integration
- **Project Management:** Trello/Jira for task tracking
- **Documentation:** Markdown files in repository

## Data Management & Persistence

### Player Data Structure

Player data is organized into several categories:

```lua
PlayerData = {
    -- Player profile and meta information
    Profile = {
        JoinDate = 0,
        LastLogin = 0,
        PlayTime = 0,
        Settings = {}
    },

    -- Economy data
    Economy = {
        Currency = 0,
        PremiumCurrency = 0,
        Transactions = {}
    },

    -- House and building data
    Housing = {
        OwnedPlots = {},
        Houses = {
            -- Each house is a table of furniture items with properties
            [HouseID] = {
                Furniture = {},
                Customization = {},
                Layout = {}
            }
        }
    },

    -- Career and job progression
    Careers = {
        -- Each job has its own progression data
        [JobType] = {
            Level = 1,
            XP = 0,
            Unlocks = {},
            Stats = {}
        }
    },

    -- Vehicle ownership and customization
    Vehicles = {
        OwnedVehicles = {},
        Customizations = {}
    },

    -- Achievements and progression
    Achievements = {
        Completed = {},
        Progress = {}
    },

    -- Inventory items
    Inventory = {
        Furniture = {},
        Clothing = {},
        Collectibles = {}
    },

    -- Social data
    Social = {
        Friends = {},
        BlockedUsers = {},
        RecentInteractions = {}
    }
}
```

### Data Store Implementation

- **Main Data Store:** Stores the complete player data structure
- **Ordered Data Stores:** Used for leaderboards and rankings
- **Global Data Store:** For game-wide statistics and events

### Data Saving Strategy

- **Auto-Save:** Player data is automatically saved at regular intervals (every 5 minutes)
- **Event-Based Saving:** Critical actions trigger immediate saves
- **Graceful Exit Saving:** Data is saved when players leave the game
- **Backup System:** Periodic backups to prevent data loss

### Data Migration & Versioning

- **Schema Versioning:** Each data structure has a version number
- **Migration Functions:** Code to upgrade data from older versions
- **Backwards Compatibility:** Ensuring new code works with old data structures

---

## Server-Client Communication

### Remote Events & Functions

The game uses a structured approach to RemoteEvents and RemoteFunctions:

- **Naming Convention:** `System_Action` (e.g., `Building_PlaceFurniture`)
- **Validation:** All remote calls include validation parameters
- **Rate Limiting:** Frequency caps on client-initiated events

### Communication Patterns

- **Command Pattern:** Client sends action requests, server validates and executes
- **Notification Pattern:** Server broadcasts events to relevant clients
- **Query Pattern:** Client requests data, server responds with validated information

### Network Optimization

- **Data Compression:** Minimizing payload size for frequent updates
- **Batched Updates:** Combining multiple small updates into single transmissions
- **Relevancy Filtering:** Only sending data to clients who need it

---

## Performance Optimization

### Client-Side Optimization

- **Asset Streaming:** Loading assets based on proximity and visibility
- **Level of Detail (LOD) System:**
  - Multiple detail levels for frequently used assets
  - Dynamic adjustment of model complexity based on distance and viewing angle
  - Prioritized LOD for high polygon count objects (vehicles, buildings)
- **Render Distance Management:** Dynamic adjustment based on client performance
- **Effect Throttling:** Reducing particle effects and visual complexity based on FPS
- **Rendering Optimizations:**
  - Occlusion culling for complex interiors
  - Instanced rendering for repeated objects (trees, street furniture)
  - Optimized shadow rendering with cascaded shadow maps

### Server-Side Optimization

- **Task Scheduling:** Distributing heavy computations across multiple frames
- **Zone-Based Processing:** Only updating active areas of the game world
- **Player Clustering:** Optimizing server resources based on player distribution
- **Heartbeat Optimization:** Efficient use of RunService events
- **Advanced Asset Streaming:**
  - Priority-based asset loading (essential vs. decorative)
  - Asynchronous loading for non-critical assets
  - Predictive loading system based on player movement direction

### Memory Management

- **Object Pooling:**
  - Reusing instances instead of creating/destroying
  - More aggressive pooling for frequently instantiated objects
- **Garbage Collection Awareness:**
  - Minimizing table churn and string concatenation
  - Memory profiling in development builds to identify leaks
  - Garbage collection optimization during low-activity periods
- **Asset Unloading:** Removing unused assets from memory

## Security & Anti-Exploit Measures

### Server Authority

- **Authoritative Server Model:** Server validates all game-changing actions
- **Client Prediction:** Client predicts outcomes but server has final say
- **Reconciliation:** Correcting client state when it diverges from server
- **Server-side Movement Validation:** Verifying player movements are physically possible

### Exploit Prevention

- **Input Validation:** Thorough checking of all client inputs
- **Rate Limiting:** Preventing action spam and timing exploits
- **Sanity Checks:** Verifying that actions are physically possible
- **Anomaly Detection:**
  - Flagging suspicious patterns of behavior
  - Statistical analysis of player actions
  - Honeypot systems to identify exploitation attempts

### Data Protection

- **Secure Storage:** Using appropriate scope for sensitive data
- **Encryption:**
  - Obfuscating sensitive values when necessary
  - Enhanced encryption for sensitive player data
- **Access Control:**
  - Limiting script access to only necessary components
  - More granular access controls
  - Audit logging for all data modifications

### Moderation Tools

- **In-game Reporting:** System with evidence capture for player reports
- **Admin Dashboard:** Comprehensive tools for moderation actions
- **Content Filtering:** Automated filtering beyond Roblox's default systems

function SystemName.PublicFunction(params)
    -- Input validation
    -- Call private functions
    -- Return results
end

return SystemName
```
