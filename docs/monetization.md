### Purchase Flow

The optimized purchase experience uses Roblox's native purchase flow:

1. Player selects item or currency package
2. Clear confirmation shows exact cost in Robux
3. System uses Roblox's MarketplaceService for purchase processing
4. Transaction is completed through Roblox's secure purchase API
5. Item or currency is delivered immediately
6. Transaction is recorded for customer support purposes

## Economic Balancing

### Currency Flow Management

Strategies for maintaining economic health:

- **Faucets**: Ways currency enters the system
  - Job earnings (primary source)
  - Quest rewards

- **Sinks**: Ways currency leaves the system
  - Building purchases
  - Vehicle acquisitions
  - Cosmetic items
  - Convenience features

Setting appropriate values and costs:

- Base soft currency earning rate: ~1,000 Blooms per hour of active play

- Premium currency items have clear value proposition vs. soft currency items

### Inflation Prevention
