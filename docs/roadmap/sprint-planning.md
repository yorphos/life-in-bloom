## Sprint Planning Overview

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the MVP phase sprints, including specific tasks, assignments, and deliverables. Each sprint is two weeks long and follows an agile methodology with daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.

### Sprint Cadence

- **Sprint Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Sprint Planning:** First day of sprint (1-2 hours)
- **Daily Progress Check:** Brief daily review of progress (5-10 minutes)
- **Sprint Review:** Last day of sprint (30-60 minutes)
- **Sprint Retrospective:** Last day of sprint (30 minutes)

### Task Estimation

Tasks are estimated using story points on a Fibonacci scale (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13):

- **1 point:** Very simple task, few hours of work
- **2-3 points:** Straightforward task, 1-2 days of work
- **5 points:** Moderate complexity, 3-4 days of work
- **8 points:** Complex task, up to a week of work
- **13 points:** Very complex task, should be broken down further

### Team Capacity

- **Solo Developer:** ~40-50 points per sprint (handling all aspects of development)

## Sprint 1: Technical Foundation

**Duration:** Weeks 1-2

## Sprint Planning Best Practices

### Before the Sprint

1. **Backlog Refinement:**

   - Review and update the product backlog
   - Ensure stories are properly sized and prioritized
   - Clarify acceptance criteria for each task

2. **Capacity Planning:**

   - Consider personal availability and energy levels
   - Account for non-development tasks (admin, planning, etc.)
   - Be realistic about velocity as a solo developer

3. **Dependencies:**
   - Identify dependencies between tasks
   - Sequence work to minimize blocking issues
   - Prepare alternative tasks to work on if blockers occur

### During Sprint Planning

1. **Goal Setting:**

   - Establish a clear, focused sprint goal
   - Keep the goal visible during the sprint
   - Connect tasks to the overall project vision

2. **Task Breakdown:**

   - Break down stories into specific, manageable tasks
   - Ensure tasks are small enough (ideally 1 day or less)
   - Group similar tasks for efficiency (e.g., all UI work together)

3. **Commitment:**
   - Be honest about what can realistically be accomplished
   - Avoid overcommitting to prevent burnout
   - Leave buffer for unexpected issues and challenges

### During the Sprint

1. **Daily Progress Check:**

   - Brief daily review of progress toward sprint goal
   - Identify any blockers or challenges early
   - Adjust plans as needed based on progress

2. **Visibility:**

   - Keep a visual task board to track progress
   - Update task status regularly
   - Document issues and decisions for future reference

3. **Focus & Balance:**
   - Minimize context switching between different types of tasks
   - Balance creative and technical work to maintain energy
   - Take regular breaks to maintain productivity and perspective
