## Sprint Planning Overview

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the MVP phase sprints, including specific tasks, assignments, and deliverables. Each sprint is two weeks long and follows an agile methodology with daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.

### Sprint Cadence

- **Sprint Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Sprint Planning:** First day of sprint (2 hours)
- **Daily Stand-ups:** Every workday (15 minutes)
- **Sprint Review:** Last day of sprint (1 hour)
- **Sprint Retrospective:** Last day of sprint (1 hour)

### Task Estimation

Tasks are estimated using story points on a Fibonacci scale (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13):

- **1 point:** Very simple task, few hours of work
- **2-3 points:** Straightforward task, 1-2 days of work
- **5 points:** Moderate complexity, 3-4 days of work
- **8 points:** Complex task, up to a week of work
- **13 points:** Very complex task, should be broken down further

### Team Capacity

- **Developers (3):** ~30 points per developer per sprint
- **Artists (2):** ~25 points per artist per sprint
- **Designer (1):** ~30 points per sprint
- **QA (1, part-time):** ~15 points per sprint

## Sprint Planning Best Practices

### Before the Sprint

1. **Backlog Refinement:**

   - Review and update the product backlog
   - Ensure stories are properly sized and prioritized
   - Clarify acceptance criteria

2. **Capacity Planning:**

   - Consider team availability (vacations, meetings, etc.)
   - Account for non-development tasks
   - Be realistic about velocity

3. **Dependencies:**
   - Identify dependencies between tasks
   - Plan work to minimize blocking issues
   - Prepare contingency plans for critical dependencies

### During Sprint Planning

1. **Goal Setting:**

   - Establish a clear sprint goal
   - Ensure the team understands the purpose of the sprint
   - Connect tasks to the overall project vision

2. **Task Breakdown:**

   - Break down stories into specific tasks
   - Ensure tasks are small enough (1-2 days of work)
   - Assign clear owners for each task

3. **Commitment:**
   - Team should commit to the sprint backlog
   - Avoid overcommitting
   - Leave buffer for unexpected issues

### During the Sprint

1. **Daily Stand-ups:**

   - Focus on progress toward sprint goal
   - Identify blockers quickly
   - Adjust plans as needed

2. **Visibility:**

   - Keep the sprint board updated
   - Track progress visually
   - Highlight risks and issues

3. **Collaboration:**
   - Encourage pair programming for complex tasks
   - Hold design reviews for critical components
   - Maintain open communication channels
